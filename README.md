# Lzy

Lzy is my personal terminal helper, she knows where my stuff is and can find it for me quickly, and in exchange I will keep adding extra commands so she can be super helpful.

If you decide to use lzy I would strongly advice forking her as she will get randomly updated with whatever random ideas I come up with ahahhaha. This is also for my own entertainment only so I will not be doing any support.

Installing lzy:
- `git clone <repo>`
- `npm install -g`

Using
- `lzy` should show you all the commands currently avaliable to you
- `lzy init` allows you to set up your basic config, any settings required for lzy to run will be set in there.
