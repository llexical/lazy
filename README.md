# Lazy

Lazy is my personal terminal helper, she knows where my stuff is and can find it for me quickly, and in exchange I will keep adding extra commands so she can be super helpful.

If you decide to use Lazy I would strongly advice forking her as she will get randomly updated with whatever random ideas I come up with ahahhaha. This is also for my own entertainment only so I will not be doing any support.

Installing Lazy:
- `git clone <repo>`
- `npm install -g`

Using
- `lazy` should show you all the commands currently avaliable to you
- `lazy init` allows you to set up your basic config, any settings required for Lazy to run will be set in there.
- `lazy code [foldername]` opens in vscode the folder you pass in (`lazy init` required)
- `lazy open [foldername]` opens in finder the folder you pass in (`lazy init` required)
- `lazy volume [volume]` sets mac volume via commandline
- `lazy spotify [action]` allows you to play, pause, quit, next, prev on spotify through commandline
